Our Program reads in a file of MLB pitch data and displays a table with a breakdown of the differnet pitches and there average speeds. It also displays some data analysis of other specific pitches. It leaves the opportunity for much expansion and deeper analysis of the data in the future. Linked below is the dataset we used in the testing and design of the program.

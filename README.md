# INST326-Group-Project
A repository for the INST326 Group Project. 
Our Program reads in a file of MLB pitch data and displays a table with a breakdown of the different pitches and their average speeds. It also displays some data analysis of other specific pitches. It leaves the opportunity for much expansion and deeper analysis of the data in the future. Linked below is the dataset we used in the testing and design of the program. Due to the size of the dataset output of the program is rather slow so we uploaded a trimmed down version to use to test the program.
